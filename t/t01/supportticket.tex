The tech support at the rebel camp has recently been automated with an RDBMS.
This includes a support ticket subsystem.
Staff with technical problems can go to the support website and
create a support ticket.
When John Doe first creates a support ticket, his information (i.e., email address) is
stored in the \texttt{SupportTickets} table.
A support ticket id is automatically generated.
He also has to enter a subject and a short message.
His message is stored in the \texttt{Notes} table.
For a support ticket, there are several extra messages entered into the system.
For instance if the support personnel replies to John Doe, that message is stored in
the \texttt{Notes} table.
If the support personal cannot resolve the issue immediately, he will enter notes
into the system for future reference.
Each note has a state tag.
A note from John Doe has state 0.
A note replied back to John Doe has state 9.

In the example below, support ticket with id 3 has a total of 9 notes.
Princess Leia is bossy and wants to check on the productivity of the
support personnel.
Therefore she needs to know the total wait time for users of the support system.
For instance in the case of support ticket 3,
the first message arrived at time stamp 5 (state 0).
A reply was sent out at time 10 (state 9).
The waiting time is $10 - 5 = 5$.
But the issue was not resolved -- a follow up question was posted at time 24.
A reply was then sent at time 30.
At this point, the total wait time is $(10 - 5) + (30 - 24) = 11$.
However, the issue is still not resolved so that a second follow up question
was entered at time 45.
A few personal notes were entered while the support personnel research on the problem
(state 1, 4, 7).
Finally a reply was sent at time 68.
At this point, the total wait time for the user is $(10-5) + (30 - 24) + (68 - 45) = 34$.
Note that support ticket with id 3 is handled by employee with employee id 97.
(More generally, a support question can be handled by multiple employees.)

Consider the following schema:
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
    SupportTickets(\underline{sid:integer},
                   email:string,
                   subject:string)
                   
    Employees(\underline{eid:integer},
              name:string)
              
    Notes(\underline{sid:integer},
          \underline{eid:integer},
          state:integer,
          note:string,
          time:integer)
\end{Verbatim}
