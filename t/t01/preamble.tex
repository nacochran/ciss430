You are part of the rebel group.
But lucky you -- you work in the IT department.
No dangerous missions.
But your immediate boss is Princess Leia -- and she's bossy.
Well at least you don't have to worry about meeting Darth Vader and having an arm or
leg
sliced off.

At the rebel base, they have a RDBMS system that keeps track of the flights
for transport of personnel, food supplies, etc.
Here's the schema (i.e., structure of tables):
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
    Flights(\underline{fno: integer},
            from: string,
            to: string,
            distance: integer,
            departs: time,
            arrives: time)
          
    Aircraft(\underline{aid: integer},
             aname: string,
             cruisingrange: integer)
           
    Certified(\underline{eid: integer},
              \underline{aid: integer})
            
    Employee(\underline{eid: integer},
             ename: string,
             salary: integer)
\end{Verbatim}
For each table, the field(s) underlined form(s) the key.

The employee table contains pilot and non-pilot employees.
Every pilot is certified to fly some aircraft (but possibly not all).

Write down the SQL query that answers the
queries below.
If you believe a query cannot be expressed in SQL,
write ERROR and explain (briefly please)
why it cannot be done.
