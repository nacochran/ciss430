Write an SQL statement to answer this query: What is the total wait time for
each support ticket?
The resulting relation has the support ticket id, email of person creating the
ticket, and the total wait time.
You must not assume that for every sid, for each note with state 0, there's
a followup note with state 9, i.e.,
do not assume the state 0 notes and state 9 notes
pair up.
It's possible to have a state 0 that is not paired up with a state 9 note.

In the case when the question-reply sequence (for a fixed
support ticket id) is
$Q_1 R_1 Q_2 R_2 Q_3 R_3 Q_4$ (where $Q_i$ is a question
and $R_j$ is a reply), the total wait time should ignore the
last question $Q_4$ since there's no reply yet.
For the case when the sequence is $Q_1 Q_2 R_1$, i.e., there are
two questions and one reply, you assume 
$R_1$ replies both $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ and therefore the
total time is the sum of two difference between
$R_1, Q_1$ and
$R_1, Q_2$.
