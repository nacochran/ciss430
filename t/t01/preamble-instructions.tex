\textsc{Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
\li This is a open-book, no-discussion, no-calculator, no-browsing-on-the-web
test.
Open-book mean only my notes.
You may use your MySQL shell.
\li Cheating is a serious academic offense. If caught you will 
receive an immediate score of -100\%.
\li
If any of the question cannot be answered, write ERROR.
For instance if an SQL statement cannot be written to answer a query,
write ERROR.
If the problem cannot be solved using SQL,
briefly explain why.
\li Do not use recursion in this test.
\end{enumerate}

All the questions involve writing SQL statements.
